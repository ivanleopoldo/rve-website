					RVE is a Non-professional E-Sports group based in the Philippines. This group was founded by yubi and was named after RavieRaven or Elle. This group was formerly known as Toko Manji Gang or TSM for short. The group also has an ambassador which is Iann Legaspi who is a K-Pop idol in a group called SEVEN-OTEEN. It was founded because the group were clappin' kids in Phantom Forces and decided to just create a Gang.

					The group plays in various different games and were once called "Jack of All Trades" when RVE dominated the Epic MiniGames Lobby in Roblox. We brought fear into the hearts of 9 year olds and we are proud.
